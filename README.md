# iCruit

## How it works
This iOS application allows recruiters to customize questions, color, and company name in a survey application for prospective applicants at Career Fairs and other recruitment events.  The data can then be exported via a CSV in an email after the event has concluded.

## Installation
To install, simply clone or download this repo. After that, open the XCode project with XCode and go to Product > Run with your iPad as the target.  There are no external dependencies outside of those built into XCode.
